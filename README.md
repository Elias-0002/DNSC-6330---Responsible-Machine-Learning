### Quantitative Analysis

NOTE: You should briefly address your other models as “alternative approaches” in
the Quantitative analysis section, and point to why your main model is a better choice.

NEW:
∗ **State the metrics used to evaluate your group’s best remediated model**: 
∗ **State the values of the metrics for training, validation, and evaluation (or “test”) data – evaluation (or “test”) metrics come from the most recent class full evaluation results, link under Assignment 1.**: 
∗ **Provide at least one plot or table from each weekly assignment for a total of at least six plots, that must include the global variable importance and partial dependence of your group’s best remediated model.**: 
∗ **Address other alternative models considered**: 


* Models were assessed primarily with AUC and AIR. See details below:

| Train AUC | Validation AUC | Test AUC |
| ------ | ------- | -------- |
| 0.3456 | 0.7891  | 0.7687* |

Table 1. AUC values across data partitions. 

| Group | Validation AIR |
|-------|-----|
| Black vs. White | 0.8345 |
| Hispanic vs. White | 0.8765 |
| Asian vs. White | 1.098 |
| Female vs. Male | 1.245 |
